// own menus -- a smoky backdrop with a glow in one corner, a column of
// right-aligned entries with a black bar under the chosen one, and a pane
// beside it that says what the entry does or how a job is going.
//
// The screen is a description (Frame) the caller fills each frame; a later
// feature adds entries and, for a screen with real controls, widgets in the
// pane, which is an ordinary Dear ImGui window area.
